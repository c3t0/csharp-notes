## Exceptions

@ run time as opposed to compilation errors

### Try Catch Block

## Specific cases first

## Genral cases last

when using a class look for the possible exceptions

These will guide the catch situations that you will need to account for 

You should wrap exception handing around code that has an outside dependency like file access, network access, etc.

 You should attempt to handle the exception quietly first before alerting the user to the problem

Exception handling should be at the beginning of the development process.
